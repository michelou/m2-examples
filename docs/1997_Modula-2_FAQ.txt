                 Modula-2 Frequently Asked Questions
What is new in version 2.7?
The FAQ location has not changed after all.  What did change was the
location of
the shareware textbook, which now starts at http://www.twu.ca/rsbook/ The
reference to Yahoo is updated. A rather strange question is asked and
answered as
4.15. Some vendor info has been updated (XTech, Mill Hill, Stonybrook, ULM).
The Sun site reference to Linux is here now. Section 1.12 on the advantages
over C
has been expanded a little. New random number generator and math library
references have been added.


What was new in version 2.6?
Stonybrook Modula-2 for Windows95/NT is here!!!  There are more references to
source code.  Multigraph has a new home page. There are some new references to
source code. Section 3.3 has a new summary of ISO compatible products for
micros.

=====================================================

SUMMARY:
1. Answers to frequently asked questions about Modula-2 will be collected at
Trinity Western University and included in this document from time to time
as it is
revised.

2. Submissions should be mailed to -- rsutc@twu.ca
Anyone making a submission guarantees that they have the right to do so
(copyright holder, or information in the public domain.) and that the

=====================================================

1. WHAT IS MODULA-2?
A. Modula-2 is a programming notation that corrects some of the
deficiencies of
Pascal. It is suitable for learning programming, for large projects written
and
maintained in the fashion of professional software engineers, and for real
time
embedded systems.


1.1 Who developed Modula-2?
A. Modula-2 was developed by Niklaus Wirth at ETH in Zurich, Switzerland in
the late 70's. Wirth also developed Pascal and Oberon.
see: http://www.stfx.ca/people/jandrea/m2/nwirth/


1.2 Where is this language described?
A. In Programming in Modula-2 3rd edition published by Springer-Verlag in
1985.
For the purposes of distinguishing this from later variants, this
description will be
referred to herein as classical Modula-2.


1.3 How do you pronounce Herr Wirth's name?
A. It is incorrect to call him by his value (worth.) Instead his name is veart.

1.4 Can I get a simple introduction to ISO Modula-2?
Yes, the latest revised edition of the shareware text as of 1996 09 06 is at
http://www.twu.ca/rsbook/
Mirrors: http://eiunix.tuwien.ac.at/Modula-2/rsbook/


1.5 How does Modula-2 fit into the language zoo?
A. It is a descendent of Pascal and Modula, and one predecessor of Modula-2+,
Modula-2*, Modula-3, Oberon, Oberon-2, and various object oriented versions of
these. The latter languages are not replacements for  Modula-2, merely later
notations in the same family, having strengths and weaknesses of their own.
Modula-2 is sometimes classified with Ada and C as the trio of modern
languages
in view of their expressive power. Modula-2 is smaller and more readable than
either.


1.6 What are the differences between Modula-2 and Pascal?
A. Modula-2 has separately compiled library modules, and makes much less
use of
blocks (begin...) than Pascal. Identifiers are case sensitive; there is no
goto label;
and I/O is in libraries rather than built in. The IF statement is more
versatile; and
there are facilities for concurrent programming via coroutines.


1.7 What is ISO Standard Modula-2?
A. A committee of ISO JTC1/SC22/WG13 with delegates from several countries
has met since 1987 to work on a standard description of Modula-2 and a set of
standard library modules.

A2. The official home of the ISO Modula-2 working group WG13 is at
http://sc22wg13.twi.tudelft.nl/

1.7.1 What is the status of ISO Standard Modula-2?
A. The international standard (IS 10514) has been voted on and is now official.


1.7.2 Where can I get the Modula-2 standard?
A1. Contact your national standards body or ISO (the publisher.)

A2. For an older version, try looking in ftp://ftp.mathematik.uni-
ulm.de/pub/soft/modula/standard/draft4/

1.7.3 What format is the standard document in?
A. Latex.


1.7.4 Who is the convenor of the standards group (WG13)?
A.Martin Schoenhacker of Vienna has been approved by SC22 as the new
convenor.


1.7.5 When was the last WG13 meeting?
A1. It was June 3-7 in Oxford, UK.  For more details, follow
http://sc22wg13.twi.tudelft.nl/docs/meetings.html


1.7.6 When is the next WG13 meeting?
A1. It will be in the Spring of 1997 at Linz in conjunction with the
conference on
Modular Languages.


1.7.7 Will I be able to read the standard?
A1. The concrete syntax is written in a variation of EBNF (Extended
Backus-Naur
Formalism) and should be accessible to most.

A2. Much of the document's details are written in VDM-SL (Vienna Development
Method - Specification Language) which is a formalism for giving a precise
definition of a programming language in a denotational style. It is worth
learning
VDM-SL if you plan to write a compiler or take a course in formal methods.


1.7.8 Can I at least get electronic copies of the definition modules?
A. Yes, in ftp://FTP.twu.ca/pub/modula2/ISOLibraries/ISODEFMods/ or
ftp://ftp.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/pub/soft/modula/standard/libdefs/


1.7.9 Can I get copies of the grammer?
A1. Yes, in http://www.twu.ca/rsbook/Appendices/Ap3.html
A2. For classical Modula-2, see also COCO (section 4.9)
A3. There are nice syntax diagrams for classical Modula-2 in
http://cuiwww.unige.ch/db-
research/Enseignement/analyseinfo/Modula2/BNFindex.html
 and there are syntax diagrams for ISO Modula-2 stored at
http://www.twu.ca/rsbook/Appendices/Ap2.html


1.8 What difference is there between classical and ISO Modula-2?
A. ISO Modula-2 has resolved most of the ambiguities in classical Modula-2. It
adds the data type COMPLEX and LONGCOMPLEX, exceptions, module
termination (FINALLY clause) and a complete standard I/O library. There are
numerous minor differences and clarifications.


1.8.1 What else is WG13 doing?
A. WG13 is working on two additional standards (separate from the main one)
for
(a) object oriented Modula-2 and (b) generic programming facilities. Both
passed
the registration ballot as CDs and will now proceed to final drafting. Various
versions of the latest generics proposal (ca101) and the disposition of
comments
(ca100) are stored in the directory ftp://FTP.twu.ca/pub/modula2/WG13/

1.9 What is (was) Turbo Modula-2
A. Borland prepared CP/M versions of Modula-2 and sold them for a time in
Europe (also in North America via a distributer.) One of these versions later
migrated to become TopSpeed Modula-2.

1.10 Where and for what is Modula-2 used?
A1. Modula-2 is widely used for teaching the fundamentals of sound
programming techniques, data structures, and software engineering in many
parts
of the world. It is the language of choice in much of Europe. It has
features that
make it superior to other languages for large projects and for programming and
real time controllers.


A2. Here is a message sent in by a maker of test equipment:
Our BoardWizard range of test equipment has compilers,pseudo-code interpreters
and a complete test operating system written in M2.  The code was written
for one
tester in 1987 and has been maintained from that date to the present. New
tester
models have added and new interface and UI code has been written, indeed
sections have been completely re-written but much of the core test logic is
untouched since about 1990 when I shifted to management.  Much of the code is
unknown to those who maintain it - yet when i look at it after several
years I can
still explain it to others even though comments are sparse. I believe that
that is the
hallmark of a great programming language. (Emphasis added.)

1.12 Why do universities use Modula-2 for teaching instead of C or C++?
A. Modula-2 is a type-safe language and its compilers will therefore catch
many
errors that otherwise show up at run time. While professional programmers need
to learn C because it is commonly used, it is important to begin a
discipline of
deliberate, engineered programming at the outset. Modula-2 is easier to
write in,
easier to read (it reads left to right) and easier to debug in. It lends
itself well to
software engineering. Modula-2 is a Higher Level Language than C, particularly
with respect to pointers, all of which have types that depend on what is
pointed to,
and which can be treated as addresses only by flagging this in the program.
A2. Here are the results of a survey of university usage of Modula-2 done by
Bernhard Leitch

1.13 Why is Modula-2 a good language for large commercial projects?
A1. It supports modular design which reduces errors and cuts down on
maintenance time.  This also allows platform dependencies to be isolated,
increasing portability.

A2. see: Griffith, Laurie Modula-2 is three times less error prone than C,
Proceedings of
the Second International Modula-2 Conference, Loughborough University of
Technology, UK, September 1991, pp 332-338.

1.14 Where do I get information on Oberon and Modula-3?
A. These languages have their own newsgroups. The Modula-3 FAQ is located at
http://www.vlsi.polymtl.ca/m3/faq.html and Oberon has an interesting page at
http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~laden/Ob-pkgs.html

1.15 Where do I get information on Modula-2*?
A. Try http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/Tichy/m2star

1.16 Where do I get information on YAFL?
A. This is yet another OO and Generic derivative of Modula-2. The homepage for
the language is at http://www.phidani.be/yafl/index.html

4.4 Are there any mathematical libraries available?
A1. See Numerical Procedures in Modula-2 -- authorized translation of
Numerical
recipes in Pascal from PolyWare 1992 420 Ruston Rd Toronto, Ontario Canada

A2. A numerical analysis package (as Modula-2 source files) is now available=
=2E
Information can be found at:
http://www.ee.newcastle.edu.au/users/staff/peter/m2/NumAnal.html
=46rom this point one can download a classical (PIM) version or a standard (=
ISO)
version.

The modules in this package are:
    Complex arithmetic: most of the usual operations, including the
         recently-requested SIN and COS.
    Matrices: operations on matrices of any size (up to a maximum
         size limit, of course) - things like addition, multiplication,
         inverse, solving linear equations, eigenvalues.
    Polynomials: including root-finding.
    Fast Fourier Transform.
    Solving ordinary differential equations.

A3. LMathLib is a library that defines a number of mathematical functions fo=
r
Modula 2 programs. Unlike other libraries of the same kind, LMathLib
patches the
Modula 2 compiler. All library functions are inlined as assembler code for t=
he
=46loating Point Unit. This results in faster code compared to the
traditional solution
with subroutine calls. Due to this machine dependent technique, you can use
the
library ONLY with the (free) GMD Modula System Mocka for Linux on INTEL
based machines. You can get the LMathLib library via anonymous ftp from
ftp://tee-1.tee.uni-essen.de/pub/Mocka/(132.252.131.33) Documentation is
included.



4.5  Where can I get a Modula-2 to C converter?
A: The program mtc is available by anonymous ftp from
  file://ftp.psg.com/pub/modula-2/grosch/mtc.tar.Z
  file://ftp.ira.uka.de/pub/programming/cocktail/mtc.tar.Z
  file://rs1.rrz.uni-koeln.de/usenet/comp.archives/languages/modula-2/mtc
    An already ported version for DOS+DJGPP can be found at
file://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/unix/programming/compilerbau/dos/mtc/
    There is an already ported Linux version too.  It can be found on the
Sun site at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/devel/lang/modula-2/
    Several of the compilers available work by producing C code and can
also serve
this purpose. See p1 and XDS listings.


4.6  Where can I get a Modula-2 to Modula-3 converter?
A. m2tom3 is available under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License from
ftp://ftp-i3.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/Modula-3-Contrib/m2tom3/
   m2tom3 is a system to port Modula-2 programs to Modula-3. It consists
of two parts:
 - A conversion program which tries to create a Modula-3 source text
   with the same semantics as the Modula-2 input while retaining the
   original look and feel as good as possible.
 - A base library which tries to emulate the Modula-2 standard library
   using the Modula-3 standard library.

4.7 Are there any Modula-2 applications around?
A. The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) develops and maintains a
now ~350,000 line public domain MODULA-2 reusable component library called
SAGE. For more information on SAGE send E-Mail to hotline@sage.inel.gov and
see the FTP server at ftp://sageftp.inel.gov/ftp/pub/sage/


4.8 Is there a Modula-2 version available for parallel processing?
A. IPD Modula-2* team has released version 9401 of the new Modula-2*
programming environment for several architectures.
You can get the IPD Modula-2* distributions for all supported architectures =
by
anonymous ftp from ftp://ftp.ira.uka.de/pub/programming/modula2star/
Please do not forget to use binary mode when retrieving any of them! Registe=
r
your copy with the registration secretary: ipdm2s@ira.uka.de For further
information and bug reports please contact the IPD Modula-2* team at
msc@ira.uka.de


4.9 Are there any compiler construction tools available?
A1. Some old ones appear in ftp://ftp.gmd.de/GMD/cocktail/

AA2. Coco/R generates recursive descent parsers and their associated scanner=
s
from attribute grammars.  Full source code, and a variety of simple example
applications are supplied in the distribution kits.  The Modula versions
(1.39 is the
latest) are available from
ftp://ftp.inf.ethz.ch:/pub/software/Coco
ftp://ftp.psg.com:/pub/modula-2/coco
ftp://cs.ru.ac.za:/pub/coco
ftp://ftp.fit.qut.edu.au:/pub/coco
There are versions for the MS-DOS compilers (JPI, FST, Logitech, StonyBrook,
Gardens Point), for the Mocka compiler for Linux and FreeBSD, as well as
for the
Gardens Point Unix compilers, including Linux and FreeBSD.  There is also a
version that produces TurboPascal units very similar to the Modula modules. =
A
port for the P1 compiler on the Mac should be available soon.  A port by Rol=
f
Schrader for TDI Atari Modula-2 is now available from
ftp://cs.ru.ac.za:/pub/coco/ATARI136.EXE  in the form of an MS-DOS self-
extracting file.  This may also be unpacked by using the LHA decompressor on
other systems.

A2. A copy of the EBNF for ISO Modula-2 can be found in
http://www.twu.ca/faculty/rsbook/Appendices/Ap3.nisus.html


4.10 Does anyone know of a lexical analysis tool that is written in
Modula-2 and

4.11 What can you tell me about debuggers?
A. For gnu, try http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/info/info/gdb.info,Modul=
a-
2

4.12 Is there an applications framework for Windows programming?
A. Try looking at
ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/sjr/m2afx.zip
orftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/platforms/pc/windows/programming/modula/
m2afx.zip

This software is an application framework that implements a number of classe=
s
that encapsulate the weirdness of the Windows C API and attempts to present
it in
a cleaner way to the Modula-2 programmer.

4.13 Does there exist something to convert a C header file to a Modula-2
DEFINITION MODULE file for me?
A. Try looking at the xTech Ltd site for the H2D freeware product on some
platforms
<A
4.14 Is there any Benchmark code out there?
A. Try looking at the xTech Ltd site for their benchmark suite.
http://www.dct.com/~johnm/xdsfbdlo.html#benchmarks


4.15 Where can I get the C code of a Modula-2 compiler?

A. Most Modula-2 compilers are written in Modula-2.  It seems
rather strange to me that one would want to trust the compilation of a
good language to a tool written in a poor one.

4.16 Can you help me with my assignments?
A. Some people may give you hints, but please do not subvert your professor
and
your education by submitting work other people do for you.

5. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON CODE AND ALGORITHMS

5.1 Where can I get an algorithm for an efficient random number generator?
A1. Pierre L'Ecuyer: Efficient and Portable Combined Random Number Generator=
s,
Communications of the ACM, vol. 31, no. 6, pp. 742-749. The RNG has a
period of
approximately 2.3E+18. Generating 1 000 000 numbers per second, that means
that
it would take over 73 000 years before it repeated a sequence.

A2.Have a look at
http://www.pitt.edu/~jesst63/modula2.html

A3.Look in the PMOS library. This one uses the 'Minimal standard random
number generator' described by Park & Miller, CACM 31,10,Oct 88 p1192. The
code has been checked for the 10001st random as specified in Park & Miller
p1195.
One site is:
ftp://ftp.psg.com/pub/modula-2/code/random/


***************************************************

6. WHAT ARE SOME REFERENCE MATERIALS ON MODULA-2?

A1. A shareware text I have written is available as html in
http://www.twu.ca/rsbook/Welcome.html
mirrors: http://eiunix.tuwien.ac.at/Modula-2/rsbook/
and as postscript in ftp://FTP.twu.ca/pub/modula2/Modula-
2Text/Chapters.ps/

A2. A tutorial is available at the Jumbo site in
http://www.jumbo.com/prog/dos/modula2
A3.The manuals for some of the commercial products such as TopSpeed contain
much useful information.

A4. The Gardens Point sites have documentation available (see their listing
above.)

A5. A document called Modula-2 for Pascal programmers (Postscript,10 pages)
may
be fetched by anonymous ftp at
ftp://ee.newcastle.edu.au/pub/modula2/Modula2.ps.Z
The author has not updated the contents for a couple of years, so there may =
be
minor inaccuracies in terms of the current language standard.

A6. A variety of ETH papers are stored at ftp.ftp.ethz.ch in /doc/diss,
/doc/tech-
reports and /pub/oberon/docu

7. REVIEWS OF MODULA-2 PRODUCTS.

Note: The reviews have been contributed by others and I take no
responsibility for
their accuracy or for any opinions expressed therein. I have updated some
of the
facts.

p1 Modula-2 v5.2 for Macintosh, by Marc Martin, Dec 1994.This is an excellen=
t
Modula-2 compiler, implemented as an MPW Tool. Highlights include ISO
language extensions & library, a full set of Macintosh toolbox definitions,
language
extensions to simplify toolbox programming, object-oriented extensions and
support for MacApp, greater than 32k code and globals, code generation
comparable to Apple's official compilers, several FPU code options,
multi-window
debugger, linkable with other MPW languages, detailed documentation, and
superb technical support via e-mail. Downsides include high cost (US$400),
dependency on MPW, lack of SADE support, and no native PowerPC version.
Version 5.3 is in alpha testing, and adds ANSI C output for creating PowerPC
programs under MPW or CodeWarrier.  (Now at 5.4 and still no native PC back
end -RS)

GPM, MOD32, TopSpeed and XDS are reviewed at

Appendix: AUTHOR INFORMATION AND DISCLAIMERS

Personal: I have used, written about, and taught Modula-2 (since 1983) and
have
maintained some of the information in this list for over seven years. I
have used at
least a dozen different compiler/environments in that time on five different
platforms, and have written numerous articles and reviews for publication.
I have
been a member of the ISO committee WG13 (Modula-2 standardization) since its
inception and have participated in all the debates and meetings of WG13 exce=
pt
for meeting #9 at Lake Wanaka. I have written a text on Modula-2 (now
shareware), made numerous submissions to WG13 and directed an
implementation of the ISO I/O library in order to verify its concepts. I am
the
author and project editor of Standard Generic Modula-2.

Disclaimers:
(i) I take no responsibility for anyone's use or misuse of this information.
(ii) Apart from having been a beta tester, textbook writer, programmer and
a long
time user of Modula-2, I have no financial connection with any manufacturer =
or
distributor of software. I am the author of some Modula-2 materials (some of
which are shareware) as noted herein.
(iii) In producing this material, I am NOT acting in an official capacity
for TWU,
WG13, ABC, IEEE, ACM, comp.lang.modula2, or any other organization.
(iv) Mention of a book or product is NOT an endorsement unless specifically
noted.
(v) Inclusion of materials on this list is based on relevance to Modula-2
and factual
content and is otherwise entirely without prejudice. I edit all submissions
for
brevity, clarity, and usage.
