 ANNOUNCE: H2D v1.30 is out (free Modula-2 to C binding tool)

New OS/2 and Windows NT/95 versions of H2D, a .H->.DEF translation utility,
have been released. H2D v1.30 contains a lot of changes and new
features, major
of them being:

- Generalized #variant directive
- Custom mapping of C base types to Modula-2 types
- Non-standard directives extraction
- Options renamed to follow XDS compilers style
- Control file syntax now closely matches used by XDS compilers

Due to deadlines in our custom projects, v1.30 was not intensively
tested yet,
so your feedback is more than welcome. The manual has some
inconsistencies too.
If you prefer stable software, v1.18 is still available.

H2D v1.30 for Windows NT/95 and OS/2 is available from the XDS Download
page at
http://www.*-*-*.com/
days.

Owners of Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, etc. editions of XDS products or other
Modula-2 compiler for these platforms are kindly requested to wait until we
have enough resources to build and package H2D 1.30 for these platforms.

With best regards,

Dmitry Leskov
